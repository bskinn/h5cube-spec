h5cube File Format Specification
================================

Format specification for HDF5 files containing Gaussian CUBE volumetric
data.

Work-in-progress for all content is committed on `draft`, with final
versions pushed to `master` when complete.

The specification versioning effectively follows
`Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org>`__ (major.minor.patch):

 * "patch" versions correct minor formatting errors (typos, etc.)
   that do not affect the semantic content of the specification.

 * "minor" versions add new field(s) or other semantic content to the
   specification, but do not alter or remove existing fields/content.

 * "major" versions alter or remove existing field(s)/content, and may also
   add new field(s)/content.

All versions are hosted on
`Read The Docs <http://h5cube-spec.readthedocs.io>`__.

Suggestions for changes are welcomed on the
`Issues page <https://github.com/bskinn/h5cube-spec/issues>`__.

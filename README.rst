h5cube File Format Specification
================================

Format specification for HDF5 files containing Gaussian CUBE volumetric
data.

Work-in-progress for all content is committed on ``draft``, with final
versions pushed to ``master`` when complete.

The specification versioning follows a modified version of
`Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org>`__ (``major.minor rev#``):

 * An increment in the revision level (``rev#``) indicates minor editorial fix(es),
   such as correcting typos or introducing clarification(s) that do not
   affect the semantic content of the specification.

 * An increment in the ``minor`` version level indicates that new field(s) or other
   semantic content have been added to the specification, but existing
   fields/content are unchanged.

 * An increment in the ``major`` version level indicates that existing
   field(s)/content have been removed/changed. New field(s)/content may also
   have been added.

All versions are hosted on
`Read The Docs <http://h5cube-spec.readthedocs.io>`__.

Suggestions for changes are welcomed on the
`Issues page <https://github.com/bskinn/h5cube-spec/issues>`__.
